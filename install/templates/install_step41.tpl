UPDATE
kb3_items_destroyed
LEFT JOIN kb3_items ON itd_itm_id = itm_id
LEFT JOIN kb3_invtypes ON itm_name = typeName
SET itd_itm_id=typeID<br/>

UPDATE
kb3_inv_detail
LEFT JOIN kb3_items ON ind_wep_id = itm_id
LEFT JOIN kb3_invtypes ON itm_name = typeName
SET ind_wep_id=typeID<br/>

INSERT INTO kb3_item_price
SELECT typeID, itm_value AS price
FROM kb3_items
LEFT JOIN kb3_invtypes ON itm_name = typeName
where typeID IS NOT NULL AND itm_value != 0 AND itm_value != basePrice<br/>
</pre>
Make sure you backed up those tables!<br/>
